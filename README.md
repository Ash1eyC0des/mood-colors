# Mood Journal

App with a daily check-in/quick quiz about how youâ€™re feeling mentally and physically. Each check-in is scored and assigned a color which will display a graph for a visual representation of it.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, EJS, TailwindCSS, Javascript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, dotenv, passport

Mood Journal is built with MVC architecture to enable changes to components as new features are added and to ensure the project remains maintainable as the user base grows. A key project requirement was ease of use for both mobile and desktop user experiences.

Users can add and review mood data; the default view provides a 7-day lookback. User authentication is handled by Passport middleware. EJS templating and Tailwind CSS were used to build the user interface.

## Lessons Learned:

Mood Journal was built for the GDI Hackathon 2022 - Hack for Health. This is the first hackathon that many of us on Team Mood Swings took part of. It was a logistical hurdle to try and plan meetings around the different time zones but we communicated clearly which led to a painless workflow.

We learned how to assign different features/styling to different people. We opted to use Tailwind for painless/continuous styling. We had an awesome project manager who conducted regular checkups with frontend and backend teams.

Sticking meticulously to the MVC architecture helped us navigate the codebase easier and abstracted a lot of unnecessary code from developers working on unrelated features.

## Planned Features for v2.0

- implement Google Oauth 2.0
- additional quiz questions to track more holistic health data
- implement overall health color scale
- enable feature to share your mood journal with someone you trust
