## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, EJS, TailwindCSS, Javascript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB

Mood Colors is built with MVC architecture to enable changes to components as new features are added and to ensure the project remains maintainable as the user base grows. A key project requirement was ease of use for both mobile and desktop user experiences.

Users can add and review mood data; the default view provides a 7-day lookback. User authentication is handled by Passport middleware. EJS templating and Tailwind CSS were used to build the user interface.

## Optimizations

## Lessons Learned:

## Planned Features for v2.0

- implement Google Oauth 2.0
- additional quiz questions to track more holistic health data
- implement overall health color scale
